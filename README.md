# TNSDC-Generative-AI
This project aims to apply Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) to the Fashion MNIST dataset.One kind of generative model is DCGAN, which takes a dataset and utilizes deep learning to create new images. The Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes grayscale photos of ten distinct categories of apparel, will be used in this instance. The objective is to teach the DCGAN to produce fresh, aesthetically pleasing pictures of these apparel products.
The study aims to develop a DCGAN architecture for the Fashion MNIST dataset, train it to generate realistic clothing images, evaluate their quality, and compare their performance with other generative models.
The process involves data preprocessing, designing a DCGAN architecture for generating images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, training the DCGAN, evaluating the generated images using metrics like Inception Score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance, and comparing its performance with other generative models.
